**Tiny Widget Manager** enhances the WordPress widget system by letting you control the visibility of each widget based on various conditions.

== Description ==

**Tiny Widget Manager (TWIM)** improves the WordPress widget system by allowing you to control each widget's visibility directly from the admin panel.
It’s a lightweight yet powerful tool that gives you full control over how and when widgets are displayed.

TWIM adds a simple interface below each widget for defining visibility rules. This provides site editors with a much smarter and more flexible way to manage widget visibility.

= Available show/hide conditions =

The power of TWIM lies in the variety of logic conditions it supports:
- Show/hide on specific *page(s)*
- Show/hide on specific *post type(s)* (custom or built-in)
- Show/hide on *archive* pages (category, tag, author, date)
- Show/hide by *user* status (logged-in, logged-out, user roles)
- Show/hide on *device* type (mobile, tablet, desktop)

= Global AND/OR setting for conditions =
For each widget, you can also define whether *all* conditions must be true or if *only one* is enough.
Since each group of condtions has its own show/hide setting, combinations are nearly endless.

= Active conditions indicator =
When setting visibility conditions for each of your widgets, it can soon become difficult to understand which conditions have been set.
TWIM provides a useful active condition indicator in the form of "eye" icons allowing you to check in a glance which conditions have been activated for a given plugin (see screenshots).

= Widget Class =
A dedicated input field allows you to add *custom CSS classes* to your widgets—no need for an additional plugin just for styling.

= Settings =
The settings page currently offers two options:
- Restore the classic widget management screen (instead of the block-based "Widgets" editor — see *Limitations* below).
- Choose the TWIM color theme for the admin interface.

= Limitations =
TWIM does not currently support the new block-based widget editor introduced in recent WordPress versions.
If you want to use TWIM, you must switch to the *legacy widget interface* (this can be done from the plugin’s settings).

= Development =
You can contribute to this plugin or follow development on GitHub:

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/tiny-widget-manager` directory, or install it via the WordPress plugin screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the “Plugins” menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Appearance > Widgets**, open any widget, and configure its visibility using the new panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with block-based (FSE) themes? =
No. Tiny Widget Manager currently supports classic widget-based themes only.

= Does it support custom post types and taxonomies? =
Yes, visibility rules can be applied to any registered post type or archive.

= Can I add custom CSS classes to widgets? =
Yes! A built-in input lets you apply your own classes—no third-party plugin needed.

= Will it slow down my site? =
No. The plugin is lightweight and adds minimal overhead. Visibility logic is evaluated server-side only when necessary.
